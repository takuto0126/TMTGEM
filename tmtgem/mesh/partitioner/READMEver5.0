         OVERVIEW : GeoFEM Partitioner Ver.5.0
                    June, 2002.

 1. Some known bugs have been fixed.
 2. 'Greedy Method' is no longer available.
 3. Some optimization for performance has been implemented.

         OVERVIEW : GeoFEM Partitioner Ver.4.1
                    August, 2001.

 1. Some known bugs have been fixed.
 2. Binary file format has been adopted 
    for work files. File names are 'work.*'.

    These files should be deleted by the users.

!*** NEW Features
!***

(1) Option for output of UCD-format file with overlapping
    for AVS.
(2) Users can specify the name of the output file(s)
    ("in.*" in Ver.3.0)
(3) Arbitrary number of domains (upto 128 in Ver.3.0)
(4) Option for multicolor re-ordering

!*** HOW to RUN
!***

GeoFEM command SYNOPSIS is commonly defined among analyzer, i.e.,
command syntax of for partitioner program is as follows:

	% mpirun -np 1 partGeoFEM [-in IName]

Where:

-in IName: Indicates the "input filenames". 
The default IName is "GeoFEM/in"
User has to prepare the file "IName.0" as initial 1-region grid file.

Partitioner program is actually a serial code but users has to install 
MPI, link the source files with MPI library and run the code using 
MPI library.

Output files are named "[OUTPUT].0"-"in.NPE" where NPE is the
number of partitions which user specified in the partitioning process
and [OUTPUT] is the header for output files specified by user.

If you start the partitioner code, you can
easily input parameters accordiong to interactive directions by the code.
If ">>>" appears on the screen, the code waits for parameter input.

!*** METHODS
!***

GeoFEM provides following 3 methods for partitioning :

  a. RCB (Recursive Coordinate Bisection)
  b. Greedy
  c. METIS

"RCB" is simple but fast and robust.
It is suitable for simple geometries but provides
only 2^N domains.

"Greedy" can generate arbitrary numbers of domains but
is rather slow. It's not recommended.

"METIS" is widely used public domain obtained from :

http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/

It's fast and robust.
Arbitrary numbers of domains can be obtained.

If you want to use "METIS", proceed as follows :

  1. generate "METIS" input file by (4)-menu in 
     GeoFEM partitioner

  2. run "METIS"

  3. generate partitioned GeoFEM grid files by
    (3)-menu in GeoFEM partitioner. 
     You have to type "METIS" output file name
     generated in 2.

!*** EXAMPLES
!***

1.prepare the file "tri.mini.0" in your current directory

2.type
  mpirun -np 1 partGeoFEM -in ($current directory)/tri.mini

3.just follow the interactive directions

4.specify the number of partitions "NPE" in the process

5.specify the header of output files "[OUTPUT]"

6.You can find files named "[OUTPUT].0"-"in.NPE-1" 
  in the current directory.
